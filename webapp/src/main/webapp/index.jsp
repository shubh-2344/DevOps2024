    <h1> India has a unique culture and is one of the oldest and greatest civilizations of the world.
India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km,
extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, 
India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, 
 tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.</h1>
<title> MAHARASHTRA AT A GLANCE </title>
<h2> Maharashtra, state of India, occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau in the western peninsular part of the subcontinent.
Its shape roughly resembles a triangle, with the 450-mile (725-km) western coastline forming the base and its interior narrowing to a blunt apex some 500 miles (800 km) to the east. Maharashtra is bounded by the Indian states of Gujarat to the northwest, Madhya Pradesh to the north, Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the southeast,
Karnataka to the south, and Goa to the southwest and by the union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and the Arabian Sea to the west</h2>
