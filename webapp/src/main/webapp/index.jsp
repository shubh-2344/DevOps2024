    <h1> India has a unique culture and is one of the oldest and greatest civilizations of the world.
India has achieved all-round socio-economic progress since its Independence. India covers an area of 32,87,263 sq. km,
extending from the snow-covered Himalayan heights to the tropical rain forests of the south. As the 7th largest country in the world, 
India stands apart from the rest of Asia, marked off as it is by mountains and the sea, which give the country a distinct geographical entity. Bounded by the Great Himalayas in the north, it stretches southwards and at the Tropic of Cancer, 
 tapers off into the Indian Ocean between the Bay of Bengal on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west.</h1>
